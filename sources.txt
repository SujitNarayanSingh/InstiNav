{
How to read a image
How to read a video
How to start webcam

Basic functions:
Gray image
Blur image 
Canny image
}

CH2
{
Resize a image
Crop a image
}

CH3
{
Print blue screen
Draw a line
Draw a rectangle
Draw a circle
Put text
}


CH4: 
{
Shifting a image 
Rotating a image
Resizing a image
Flipping a image
Cropping a image

}

CH5:Contour detection(boundaries)
{
Canny and threshold images
}

CH6:Color Spaces
{
BGR to grayscale
BGR to HSV
BGR to LAB
BGR to RGB
Plt func(matplotlib)
HSV to BGR
LAB to BGR
}

CH7: Color Channels
{
Split into b,g,r
Merge images
}

CH8: blurring techniques
{
Blur a image
Averaging blur

}
Stopped coding from this topic will write about concept in this document itself

CH9: Bitwise Operations
{
Bitwise AND(it will return intersection like of circle and rectangle)
Bitwise OR(it will return union like of circle and rectangle)
Bitwise XOR(it will return non-intersecting region of circle and rectangle)
Bitwise NOT( will convert white region to black and black to white)
}

CH10:Masking (allows us to focus on certain part of image)
{
Masked image of different shape by defining the size
Can also get weird masked shape using bitwise operations
}




CH11: Computing histogram (Allow us to visualize the pixel intensity)
{
Y-axis→represents number of pixels
X-axis→represents intensity 
Gray scale image histograms
Grayscale histograms of masked images
Color histograms of normal and masked images
}

CH12: Thresholding
{
1.Simple Thresholding
     Inverse Thresholding(white part changes to black and black to white)
2.Adaptive thresholding(optimal thresholding value find by computer sliding over the image)
}

CH13: Edge Detection
{
Laplacian gray image(to get gradients)
sobel(along x and y axis)
Canny edge detection
For more advanced detection sobel is preferred over canny
}

CH14:Face detection
{
Detect number of faces in a image by copying haar cascades code from github into a text file in pycharm
Make a rectangle around face
Number of faces changes when minNeighbors value changes
}

CH15: Face Recognition
