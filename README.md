# InstiNav
The goal of this project is to develop software for identifying the road/path images for an electric shuttle on a university campus. 

he project involves building an image segmentation algorithm that can identify the road/path in an image captured by the shuttle's cameras. The image segmentation algorithm will be integrated into the overall system, which will guide the shuttle to its destination.
The project involves several steps, including data collection, pre-processing, and training the image segmentation model. The image segmentation algorithm will be evaluated and refined based on its accuracy and efficiency. The final product will be tested using a set of new images and deployed on the university campus.
The project involves learning several key concepts, including image processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

Project Overview: To develop the image-based navigation system, the following steps were taken:

Python Basics: Initially, I familiarized myself with the fundamentals of the Python programming language and its associated libraries. This included gaining an understanding of Python syntax, data structures, and common libraries used in computer vision applications.

Image Segmentation: I studied articles on image segmentation, which provided insights into different types of segmentation techniques. Understanding image segmentation was crucial for extracting relevant features from images and identifying objects, including vehicles.

OpenCV Library: In this project, I utilized the OpenCV library. To gain proficiency in implementing OpenCV, I referred to video tutorials and articles that covered its usage in vehicle detection tasks. These resources helped me understand the library's functionality and how it could be applied effectively.


Image Labeling: I explored the documentation from "maths-work" that focused on image labeling in MATLAB. This information was valuable for understanding the process of labeling images, an essential step in training and validating a vehicle detection model.

Object Detection: I dedicated time to learning about object detection techniques, which are crucial for accurately identifying and localizing vehicles within images or video streams. Understanding object detection methods enabled me to make informed decisions regarding the appropriate algorithms to apply in this project.

Data Collection and Labeling: I captured images of vehicles on institute or university roads to create a dataset. These images served as the basis for labeling and training the vehicle detection model. Using MATLAB, I labeled the collected images by annotating the vehicles present in each image.
